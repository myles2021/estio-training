1. Name 3 main activity of Kanban. <br>
  – Understand the state of work flow as it is
    – Gather data on all aspects of the work including:
    – Flow of work in and out of the system
    – The capacity to pull work through the system 
    – Identifying queues and buffers
    – Mean Lead Time
  – Improve the existing system based on the collected evidence

2. What are the concepts of Push and Pull and which is used by Kanban? <br>
  Kanban is a pull-based process, so team members pull work to themselves when they have the bandwidth – work is not pushed or assigned by someone else. This also means that some team members can’t just take it easy by not pulling work, while others keep working hard – as Kanban is very visual so that everyone knows what they’re doing and people don’t drop off or even accidentally step on each others toes.

3. What is WIP Limit? <br>
  On a Kanban, an item can move to the next segment / state only when a slot is available i.e. when WIP limit is not reached.
  
4. From Kanban core concepts name 3. <br>
  – Measure the lead time 
  – Visualise workflow
  – Limit WIP
  
5. What is cumulative flow and how is calculated and visualised? <br>
  Cumulative Flow Diagram is an analytical tool, fundamental to Kanban method. It allows teams to visualize their effort and project progress. When there's an impediment about to occur within the process - the CFD is where you'll see it first. Instead of the graph staying smooth and rising gently, there will be a bump, a sudden ascend or descend. So, where being able to predict problems is concerned, this is the very graph you need.

6. Why would you start all transformations with Kanban?<br>
  So that everyone is on the same track, staff can update their own workflow and make it easily accessible to others so that no one duplicates transformations or steps on others toes, and it also allows for staff to anticipate things and work accordingly.

7. Is UX for Web page development? Briefly explain you answer.<br>
  It is in a lot of cases, but generally in DevOps we use UX techniques for capturing user stories - whatever form that may then manifest into.

8. Name the steps in User Centred Design.<br>
  It’s a loop of:
    Research -> Concept -> Design -> Develop -> Validate
    
9. Name an alternative set of steps in User Centred Design.<br>
  A looping set of steps:
    1. Understand your users
    2. Make your UX interface easy and enjoyable to use 
    3. Remain consistent
    4. Dialog and feedback with users
    5. Remedy any problems
    
10. How could UCD / UX help agile software development?<br>
  Agile is focused on the customer, where as UCD is centred on the end-user. UCD provides a way to engineer these quality experiences, and using agile methodologies it allows the changes to manifest naturally with the development and feedback of the software.
11. Name three basic principles of UCD / UX.<br>
– UCD is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments
– UCD is driven and refined by user-centred evaluation; and addresses the whole user experience
– UX techniques are also used to devise ways of capturing users experience and feedback

12. Name 3 tools / practices you can use for user stories.<br>
– Journey mapping and failure demand 
– Inclusive and accessible services
– Design patterns and tools

13. What do you expect to get after a user research?<br>
  – The output of research is the service
  – Every design decision you make should be based on research 
  – You can’t design a good service without research
  – Research is not:
    – Finding out the truth 
    – Predicting the future 
    – Pitching an idea
    
14. Name 5 user research techniques.<br>
  – Interview
  – Survey
  – Usabilitytesting – Diarystudy
  – Analytics
  
15. Name UCD & UX research methods guidelines.<br>
  – Context of use
    – Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it 
  – Requirements
    – Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful
  – Solutions design
    – This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design 
  – Evaluation
    – Evaluate Ideally through usability testing with actual users 

16. What is the benefit of Person design in user story development?<br>
  Deeper understanding of user’s needs and wants. What is the user’s real needs?

17. Name the steps in producing a Persona.<br>
  1. Identifying the groups such as “business manager”, “customer” 
  2. 2. Understanding of user’s goals, environment and motivations
  3. Deeper understanding of user’s needs and wants

18. Explain the difference between users’ ‘Wants’ and ‘Needs’.<br>
  A want is a user/customers desire, where as a need would be an essential. The nuance between the two concept are that a need is aiming to solve the bigger object issue where as a want is potentially just a slice of what the whole need is.

19. What is an A/B testing?<br>
  A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomised experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable are tested against each other. This is used to identify users’ pain points, regardless of your business, users of your service / software may face some common pain points and not able to achieve their goals. We use data gathered through tools such as heatmaps, Google Analytics, and website surveys to identify users’ paint points and improve our service / software.
  Statistics isn’t a magic number of conversions or a binary ‘Success!’ or ‘Failure’ thing. It’s a process used to make decisions under uncertainty and to reduce risk by trying to reduce the fogginess on what the outcome of a given decision will be.

20. What is Usability Testing?<br>
  It is the testing designed to develop and improve the user-friendly attributes to a product. i.e the development of the TFL map from 1910 - current, showing that realism isn’t the most user-friendly but rather clear and effective graphic design helped to improve the usability of the map.

21. Briefly explain your understanding of a User Story?<br>
  It is the story of the target audience, the pain and the solution for the pain. It is the story from the users want(s) and need(s), all the way to how the user then goes on to experience the product, as well as how user-friendly the product is (i.e UX navigation, UX solution etc.) 
  
22. What is an epic?<br>
  Epics are the most valuable and important part of a product, the fundamentals and essentials to it functioning according to the agile UCD development.
